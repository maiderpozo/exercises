# Scripting Exercise Repository

## About This Course

This coursas done*.
Your scripts have to produce correct results and it is your responsibility to check your work properly.
The first series of exercises are accompanied by tests, but with the 'real deal' exercises, that won't be the case anymore.
You will have to split up the task at hand in smaller pieces, implement helper functions, check them, etc.

We do not care *how* you solve the problem.
You are free to use all of the functionality Python provides.
It is not our goal to have you write complex algorithms.
So, please do not write your own `sum` function, use the built-in one.
You will see that Python has *a lot* of built-in functions for you to make use of.
Therefore, it is very important that you develop the habit of skimming through the documentation and looking up information online.
